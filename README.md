# iris_flowerdetection
This project is a classification problem which uses supervised learning and one of the popular machine learning algorithm for classifying different types of iris flowers. Random Forest algorithm is used in this project for classifying the types of iris flowers as it offers more robust performance and good acuuracy.Libraries that are used in this project are mentioned in requirements.txt. The iris flower dataset is taken from kaggle dataset which is in csv format.
